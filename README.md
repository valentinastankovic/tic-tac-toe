# Tic Tac Toe Game

Engineered a Java-based Tic Tac Toe application designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as game logic, state management, and clean object-oriented structure.

---

## Project Overview

This project represents a classic two-player Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. The application manages turn-based gameplay, validates player moves, updates the game board, and determines win or draw conditions.

---

## Core Contributions

### Game Logic Implementation

Implemented the complete rule system, including turn switching, input validation, win condition checks, and draw detection.

### Application Structure

Designed the project using object-oriented principles, separating responsibilities across multiple classes to improve maintainability and readability.

### State Management

Maintained consistent tracking of the game board state to ensure accurate gameplay after each player action.

### User Interaction

Implemented a clear and intuitive interaction flow for two players, ensuring smooth transitions between turns and clear end-game feedback.

## How It Works

The application runs locally and starts a new Tic Tac Toe session upon execution. Players alternate turns by making valid moves. After each move, the system updates the board state and evaluates whether a win or draw condition has been met. Once the game ends, the final result is displayed and the application terminates.
