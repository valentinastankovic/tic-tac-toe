Tic Tac Toe Game

Engineered a Java-based Tic Tac Toe application designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including game logic, state management, and structured code organization. The application provides a stable two-player experience with clear gameplay flow.

Core Contributions
Game Logic Implementation

Developed the complete rule set for the game, including turn management, move validation, win condition evaluation, and draw detection.

Application Structure

Structured the project using object-oriented principles to ensure separation of concerns and maintainable, readable code.

State Management

Implemented consistent board state tracking to accurately reflect player actions throughout the game lifecycle.

User Interaction

Designed a simple and intuitive interaction flow for two players, ensuring smooth turn transitions and clear game feedback.

How It Works

The application runs locally and initiates a two-player Tic Tac Toe session. Players alternate turns by making valid moves, while the system continuously updates the game state and evaluates winning or draw conditions. Once an end condition is reached, the final result is displayed and the session terminates.
